# Llamafile Forge

**Llamafile Forge** is a professional utility designed to convert GGUF (GGML Universal File) models into self-contained, executable **Llamafiles**. By bundling models with a high-performance inference engine, it enables one-click execution across multiple platforms without complex dependencies.

## Features

- **Modern Glassmorphism UI**: A stunning, dark-themed interface with smooth transitions and glow effects.
- **Multithreaded Conversion**: Real-time logging and progress tracking during the embedding process.
- **Cross-Platform Readiness**: Automatically handles permissions and alignment for seamless execution.
- **Validation Suite**: Ensures all paths and binaries are valid before starting the Forge process.

## How it Works

1.  **Select GGUF**: Choose your quantized model file.
2.  **Provide Base**: Select a base llamafile (the engine).
3.  **Zipalign**: Modern Llamafiles use `zipalign` to embed the model directly into the engine binary.
4.  **Forge**: Click "Bring to Life" to generate your portable AI executable.
